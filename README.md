in other browsers like microsoft edge, chrome would work the same way. i have made a mobile version of max width of 768px and 480px. 
during testing, i have issue when there is a change of screen size, there would be a big empty space on top that pushes my content below, and for the contact us form, when it is smaller screen, the form would not fit the screen size but cuts the right side.
