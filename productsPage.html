                    <h4>NMD Test Cable Assembly for VNA</h4>
                    <p>
                        VNA teat cable assemblies of Agilent (Keysight) are widely praised, but they are very expensive. We has developed several NMD test cables for VNA to address customer pain points. Divided by the using frequency division, there are 3.5mm interface cable assemblies for 26.5GHz, 2.4mm cable assemblies for 40GHz (the 40G VNA of Keysight use 2.4mm interface as test ports), and 1.85mm cable assemblies for 67GHz. NMD is a kind of interface, with two  layers of thread .The outer thread is used to guarantee the mechanical connection, and the inner one is used to ensure electrical connection. Therefore, when user shakes the VNA test cable during the test, the stability of electrical performance will not be affected.

                    <h4>Semi-Rigid Cable Assembly</h4>
                    <p>
                        Semi-rigid cable, or rigid cable, should be bent by professional operators under tooling or CNC bending machine. It is a one-time molding fixed, once bent, the shape is not reversible. There are 3 typical series semi-rigid cables: 047 series, 086 series and 141series, their diameters are 1.2mm, 2.2mm and 3.6mm. They are used in large quantities in the electronic equipment case. This cable has excellent shielding, so there is no signal crosstalk in the dense wiring environment. Its using frequency is high, up to 110GHz for 047 series. We can process them according to customers’ drawings or help customers with 3D modeling and simulation in practical engineering.
